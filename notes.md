## Ruby Basics

How to print something

```ruby
print "Griaffe Academy"
```

will print "Giraffe Academy"

```ruby
puts "Zach"
```

will print Zach right after

puts will print something and then add a new line
print will print something on a new line


## How is Ruby executed?

Ruby treats every line as a separate instruction and executes instructions in order

## Variables

In Ruby you're going to deal with a lot of data. Ruby makes it easier to deal with lots of data using the container "variable"

Pieces of data can be stored in variables and variables can refered to reference, alter, use, etc.

Variable names must be lower case and snake_case if they contain multiple words

lines of code that contain text and variables must be placed inside parentheses
